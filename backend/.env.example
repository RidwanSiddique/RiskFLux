# External APIs - Open-Meteo (Free, no API key required)
# Provides accurate weather and elevation data
# Open-Meteo API: https://open-meteo.com/ (10,000 requests/day free)
# OpenStreetMap/Nominatim: https://nominatim.org/ (1 request/second limit)

# Optional: Google Elevation API (More accurate elevation data)
# Get key from: https://console.cloud.google.com/

# Data Sources Used:
# 1. ELEVATION: Open-Meteo API (free) or Google Elevation API (requires key)
# 2. WATER DISTANCE: Overpass API (OpenStreetMap data)
# 3. WEATHER/CLIMATE: Open-Meteo Historical + WeatherAPI for climate classification
#    - Open-Meteo provides: temperature, precipitation, wind speed, snowfall
#    - WeatherAPI provides: climate type classification (Tropical, Subtropical, etc)
#    - Climate classification ensures accurate snow risk for tropical regions
# 4. GEOCODING: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free, ~1 req/sec limit)
# 5. FLOOD RISK: FEMA API + USGS StreamStats (when available in US)
#
# ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS:
# - Tropical climates: Snow risk capped at 0-1% (accurate for Dhaka, Bangkok, etc)
# - Temperate climates: Snow risk based on actual temperature data
# - Storm risk: Adjusted for climate type and latitude (hurricane zones)
# - Coastal areas: Flood risk elevated due to proximity to water
